# Predicting Numerical Outcomes and Time to Reach Them

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict both a numerical outcome and the time it will take to reach that outcome. The notebook uses synthetic data to illustrate the process, including data preparation, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

## Notebook

- **File:** `numerical_features.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to handle the prediction of a numerical outcome and the time required to achieve that outcome using Python. It covers:
  - Data preparation
  - Feature engineering
  - Modeling (separate models for outcome and time prediction)
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Saving and loading models for deployment

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn joblib
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can do this using pip as mentioned above.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

   Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to `numerical_features.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   In the Jupyter interface, open `numerical_features.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and see the results.

4. **Model Deployment**

   The notebook includes code to save and load models using `joblib`. Once you have trained the models, you can deploy them for real-time predictions as demonstrated in the notebook.

## Example Usage

The notebook includes an example of how to make predictions with the trained models. Hereâ€™s a brief snippet:

```python
import joblib

# Load the saved models
outcome_model = joblib.load('outcome_model.pkl')
time_model = joblib.load('time_model.pkl')

# Example new data
new_data = np.array([[0.5, -0.2, 0.3, 15]])  # Adjust with actual data
new_data = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Make predictions
predicted_outcome = outcome_model.predict(new_data)
predicted_time = time_model.predict(new_data)

print(f"Predicted Outcome: {predicted_outcome[0]:.2f}")
print(f"Predicted Time to Outcome: {predicted_time[0]:.2f} minutes")
```
